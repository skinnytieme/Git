    directors, agents, investors, subsidiaries, and employees) from any and all claims,
    demands, or damages (actual or consequential) of every kind and nature, known and

    in any way connected with such disputes.
</p>
<p>
    Entr expressly disclaims any liability that may arise between Users of its Service.

<h3>
    Dispute Resolution and Governing Law</h3>
<p>
    To expedite resolution and reduce the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim
    related to this Agreement ("Dispute"), you and Entr agree to first attempt to negotiate
    any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) informally for at least
    thirty (30) days before initiating any arbitration or court proceeding (hereto refereed
    to as “Informal Negotiations”).
</p>
<p>
    Such Informal Negotiations will commence upon written notice. Your address for such
    notices is your billing address, with an email copy to the email address you have
    provided to Entr. The address for such notices to be sent to Entr can be found on
    the Entr website.
</p>
<p>
    If you and Entr are unable to resolve a Dispute through Informal Negotiations, either
    you or Entr may elect to have the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded
    below) finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration (hereto refered to
    as “Binding Arbitration”).
</p>
<p>
    Any election to arbitrate by one party will be final and binding on the other. YOU
    UNDERSTAND THAT IF EITHER PARTY ELECTS TO ARBITRATE, NEITHER PARTY WILL HAVE THE
    RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration will be commenced and
    conducted under appropriate UK Commercial Arbitration Rules as recognised by the
    laws of England and Wales. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation
    will be governed by these Rules (and, where appropriate, limited by any appropriate
    UK Consumer Rules as recognised by the laws of England and Wales).
</p>
<p>
    The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement
    of reasons unless requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law,
    and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except as otherwise
    provided in this Agreement, you and Entr may litigate in court to compel arbitration,
    stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment
    on the award entered by the arbitrator.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Exceptions to Alternative Dispute Resolution.</strong></p>
<p>
    You and Entr agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions
    concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration:
</p>
<ul type="”a”">
    <li>any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of
        your or Entr’s intellectual property rights; </li>
    <li>any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion
        of privacy or unauthorised use; and </li>
    <li>any claim for injunctive relief. </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Restrictions.</strong></p>
<p>
    You and Entr agree that any arbitration will be limited to the Dispute between Entr
    and you individually. To the full extent permitted by law,
</p>
<ul type="”a”">
    <li>no arbitration will be joined with any other; </li>
    <li>there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class- action
        basis or to utilize class action procedures; and </li>
    <li>there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative
        capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons. </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Location. </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Arbitration will take place at any reasonable location within the United Kingdom
    convenient for Entr.
</p>
